# FSD-SLAM

This code is for paper "Fusing Semantic Segmentation and Object Detection for Visual SLAM
in Dynamic Scenes".

## Prerequisites

### DS-SLAM

Our system runs in the same environment as DS-SLAM, so it is necessary to configure environments according to the steps described in the [DS-SLAM](https://github.com/ivipsourcecode/DS-SLAM). 
If you encounter any difficulties in configuring the operating environment of DS-SLAM, please ask us questions. We also provide a DS-SLAM installation document in Chinese(clike me)[https://blog.csdn.net/qq_34131212/article/details/106803808?spm=1001.2014.3001.5501].

### YOLO v4
We used YOLO v4 in the experiment. See [YOLO v4](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet) for a detailed configuration process.
